I chose construction engineering for my projects because I have interest in how 3D design software relies on graphics cards (GPUs) in order to produce simulations with such accuracy. I have always found it interesting that engineers put together structures such as huge bridges or sky-scraping buildings.
   

Construction these days is no longer only concerned with building structures but is now combined with working with computers to design buildings even before construction begins. Engineers work with computers to help solve problems such as security and cost issues related to buildings, ensuring buildings are safe and aesthetic.

Sources

During my research, I discovered some cool 3D software programs that engineers use:

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview): This allows architects and engineers to create intricate computer drawings and 3D models. It can change complex designs in a short time because it makes use of GPUs.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/): Blender is free and great for creating pictures and animations of buildings. Blender is useful for teams to demonstrate what their completed projects will look like.

[Revit](https://www.autodesk.com/products/revit/overview): This one is for building information modeling. That means you can design an entire building, right down to small details, and then work out plumbing and electrical systems before you actually build anything.

[SketchUp](https://www.sketchup.com/): This is a simple design tool for creating and modifying 3D designs. This tool is great for conceptualizing and sharing designs with fellow students.

[SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/): This is used for part designs and testing. Engineers will use this to ensure that everything is working and is compatible with each other before actual construction.


These projects demonstrate that computers and high performance video cards are revolutionizing construction practices.

EDP (Engineering Design Process)

Currently, I’m beginning my engineering design process with problem-definition. I would like to concentrate on this: Many individuals do not realize just how much software and computer technology are used in construction. 3D modeling and simulation can potentially increase safety, speed, and accuracy in creating structures. Next, I will continue with my research. I will read up on several articles, test out this software on my own, and hopefully speak with individuals who work with this software on a daily basis.

Skills

I have acquired several important skills through working on this project:

Time Management: I take care to reserve time for this particular assignment by spending less time on other activities. This allows me to complete my work without any time pressure.

Smart Searching: I do a Google search for both "3D software for construction purposes" and "GPUs for building models" so I can locate the best-written articles out there and avoid reading things I don’t need.

Communication: I have a partner. We communicate through a Google Doc for research sharing. We hold a phone conversation every week to keep each other informed.

Professionalism

I’m also learning to be more professional: I keep my links organized. I always give credit for sources I use. I communicate effectively with my partner when working on assignments, meeting deadlines, and ensuring everything is good. Next Steps I can’t wait to learn more about how 3D software and GPUs can be used by engineers to build better and safer buildings. I would like to try my hand at using some software programs by myself and see if I can arrange for a personal interview with someone working in construction engineering.

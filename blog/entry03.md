* <strong>Content</strong>

  * The holographic building schematic is a 3D visualization of a building that a construction worker can see through a device or special glasses. They can zoom in on one specific area of the building and if they see that something is out of place, they can change it right there and then check if the building would fail or not. It also helps to cut down on the waste of time and money because the corrections that need to be made are done in the hologram and not on the real site.

  * The safety shoes come with sensors that can detect the situation when a worker is falling from a height and then utilize special powerful propellors to slow down the fall and rescue the worker to the greatest extent possible. These boots can be easily adjusted to fit different types of feet, and the workers remain comfortable and full of energy for a long period of time.

  * These glasses are specially crafted to protect the workers’ eyes from the dust and other such particles that might be present in the air while the workers are on the construction site. Besides that, the glasses allow workers to do alterations on the building schematic in front of them and also help them know the amount of materials like concrete or bricks that will be necessary for each part of the building.

* <strong>Sources</strong>

  * To get part B ideas I used my imagination, creativity, and games that i have played which have holographic schematics.
Information on holographic architecture and 3D building models was used to understand the role of holograms in the construction industry. The safety aspects of boots and glasses were the major points that resulted in the development of the concepts of safety boots and special glasses.

* <strong>Engineering Design Process</strong>

  * The problem is being identified and worked on with the coming up with new solutions and improvements. Unsafe construction and difficulty in visualization are the main problems and thus, the tools are created to help workers see the building in 3D, be safe from falling, and know what materials are necessary.

  * The next step of the engineering design process will include the preparation of basic models or representatives (prototypes) of the safety boots, holographic schematic, and special glasses in 3d software.

* <strong>Skills</strong>

  * A main skill in the work is problem, solving, and recognizing the dangers at a construction site and designing tools that can make the work safer and less complicated. Another skill is creativity as the invention of holograms, safety glasses, and safety boots means coming up with the idea of devices that could be used on construction sites in the future.

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* 3D modeling software is used to simulate building articheture.
* 3D modeling software helps people to construct buildings to see if they winstand something, and it is used in architecture and interior design

## Part A: Existing Technology

**Least Complex:**

Construction Software
Apps looked into: <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview">AutoDesk</a>, <a href="https://sketchup.trimble.com/en?srsltid=AfmBOooV392iJp07fJ_9oipSfhiplsvJrt9ihrW-lK_nA2OAsj_W3wK2">Sketchup</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/3d-viewers">Navisworks</a> <br>
Findings: These 3D modeling software are used to simulate if buildings would collapese or not, before actually building it. <br>
It makes construction safer because they will know that the building wont collapse when building. <br>
BIM specialists use software to create, manage, and coordinate digital models of buildings and infrastructure which use hardware like computers, graphics cards, and use software like Autodesk and Navisworks to ensure that the project goes succesfully.<br>

**Mildly Complex:**

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_card"> Graphics Cards</a> <br>
Findings: Multiple 3d construction apps use pro series graphics cards. They are engineered for reliability, featuring more VRAM and larger caches, which is crucial for handling large and complex models in architectural visualizations.<br>

**Most Complex:**

Simulation Abilities: The best simulation software is capable of analyzing building structure, energy usage, air flow, lighting, and construction sequence simulation (4D, 5D simulations).

Computing Requirements: The computing resources required by these platforms include high-end workstations, cloud computing resources, and GPUs capable of handling big data and simulations, such as point cloud processing   and reality capture from drone and laser scan data.

Artificial Intelligence & Automation: Some of the best solutions employ artificial intelligence to detect clashes, optimize design, and use predictive modeling to identify and resolve problems automatically prior to   construction.

## Part B: Future Technology

CONSTRUCTION

* Holographic Building Schematic
  * You can use a projector or special glasses that show the holograph of the building.
  * You can make it so that you only see one part of the holograph.
  * You can see what things are in its wrong place.

* Safety Boots
  * If you fall from a high place when building, it uses a special sensor to detect it, and slow down your fall.
  * You can adjust the size of the shoes.
  * You can make the shoes any design you'd like.

* Special Glasses
  * You can use your imagination to edit the schematic of the building.
  * You can use it to protect your eyes.
  * You can use it to see how much materials you need to build something.

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* 1st google search:"construction design simulation apps"
* 1st app was: https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview
* This app is used to simulate building articheture.
* This app helps people to construct buildings to see if they winstand something.
* Easy to use on computers
  Second app review:https://sketchup.trimble.com/en?srsltid=AfmBOooV392iJp07fJ_9oipSfhiplsvJrt9ihrW-lK_nA2OAsj_W3wK2
* Is a 3D modeling software
* Used by many people and is trusted
* It is used in architecture and interior design
* Supports Windows and MacOS

## Part A: existing technology
* RTX Pro series graphics cards
  * Mmltiple 3d construction apps use pro series graphics cards. They are engineered for reliability, featuring more VRAM and larger caches, which is crucial for handling large and complex models in architectural visualizations.

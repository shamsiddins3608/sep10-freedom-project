Topic: **Construction**

## Overview/Introduction/Context
* 3D modeling software is used to simulate building articheture.
* 3D modeling software helps people to construct buildings to see if they winstand something, and it is used in architecture and interior design

## Part A: existing technology

  Construction Software
  Apps looked into: <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview">AutoDesk</a>, <a href="https://sketchup.trimble.com/en?srsltid=AfmBOooV392iJp07fJ_9oipSfhiplsvJrt9ihrW-lK_nA2OAsj_W3wK2">Sketchup</a>, <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/navisworks/3d-viewers">Navisworks</a> <br>
  Findings: These 3D modeling software are used to simulate if buildings would collapese or not, before actually building it. <br>
  It makes construction safer because they will know that the building wont collapse when building. <br>
  BIM specialists use software to create, manage, and coordinate digital models of buildings and infrastructure which use hardware like computers, graphics cards, and use software like Autodesk and Navisworks to ensure that the project goes succesfully.

  Findings: Multiple 3d construction apps use pro series graphics cards. They are engineered for reliability, featuring more VRAM and larger caches, which is crucial for handling large and complex models in architectural visualizations.

  Simulation Abilities: The best simulation software is capable of analyzing building structure, energy usage, air flow, lighting, and construction sequence simulation (4D, 5D simulations).

  Computing Requirements: The computing resources required by these platforms include high-end workstations, cloud computing resources, and GPUs capable of handling big data and simulations, such as point cloud processing   and reality capture from drone and laser scan data.

  Artificial Intelligence & Automation: Some of the best solutions employ artificial intelligence to detect clashes, optimize design, and use predictive modeling to identify and resolve problems automatically prior to   construction.
